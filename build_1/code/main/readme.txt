==========

    Button 1 & 2: 
        cycle through samples for playback.

    Start:
        Play current sample.
    
    Select:
        selected between wavy patterns.
    
    Left & Right:
        cycle through different images.

    Up & Down
        Cycle through wavy animation, paused animated, and fixed sin wave.
        NOTE: The paused and fixed sin wave are to prove that when samples play back, they don't interrupt Hsync interrupt effects.
